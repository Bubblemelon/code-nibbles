# Problem Statement for sock.cpp:  

For example, there are `n=7` socks with colors `ar = [1,2,1,2,1,3,2]`. There is one pair of color `1` and one of color `2`. There are three odd socks left, one of each color. The number of pairs is `2`.

Complete the sockMerchant function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the number of matching pairs of socks that are available.

sockMerchant has the following parameter(s):

`n`: the number of socks in the pile
`ar`: the colors of each sock

**Compile + Run**:  

`gcc -lstdc++ sock.cpp -o sock` or `g++ sock.cpp -o sock`  

`./sock < case1.txt`

To have the outputs placed onto a file:  

`./sock < case1.txt > sock-output.txt`
